# Dynamic CV README
### *By GitPuleo*

*HELLO AND WELCOME FOR COMING.* 
Dynamic CV is designed to guide users step-by-step through the process of creating a CV, helping bypass not only the paralysis-inducing blank page of a Word document but also the hurdles of the hidden curriculum of "professionalism" that serve mainly to filter for class background. The application handles formatting, ordering, and assembling the resume. Conditional rendering allows the user to shift the burden of deciding relevance to the party that is actually in posession of that knowledge--the hiring team. Instead of producing endless iterations of a resume for each opportunity, a single link and conditional rendering shift the balance of responsibilities back in the applicant's favor and by-passing predatory bespoke application systems that farm user's data.
Dyanmic CV aims to simplify, demystify, and rebalance the job search process. I hope that you enjoy using it.
